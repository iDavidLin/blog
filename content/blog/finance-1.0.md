## Saving Goal
I had set up a ten-year financial savings goal starting in 2021. However, as I review my progress today, on June 17th, 2023, I am significantly ahead of my original plan. Due to COVID, I didn't travel anywhere which saves a lot of money.

## Investment
- Stock
	- I don't want to think about this.
- ETF
	- Started 1 or 2 years ago? Didn't invest much. As of now, 2022 Jul 4th, I got an 11% return. Not bad.
