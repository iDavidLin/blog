These are things that help me keep a healthy lifestyle. You don't need me to tell you why they're important.

## Little things that improve my health
- New Mattress. (Firm foam) After realising that a soft foam mattress was causing discomfort and low back pain, I finally updated it.
- New Pillow. Inspired by Scott Pape's book "The Barefoot Investor".
- Loop earplugs. As a light sleeper, the Quiet Loop earplugs block out a lot of noise. 
- Optase moist heat eye mask. Try this if you have a dry eye issue.
